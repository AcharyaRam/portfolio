        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mb-6">
          I am a B.Tech Information Technology student with a strong interest in
          web development and software engineering. I enjoy building clean,
          responsive, and user-friendly web applications using modern
          technologies.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mb-6">
          During my diploma studies, I completed an internship at KS Technology,
          where I gained practical exposure to real-world development
          environments and learned how professional projects are planned,
          developed, and maintained.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
          I am continuously improving my technical skills by building projects,
          learning new technologies, and applying my knowledge through hands-on
          practice.
