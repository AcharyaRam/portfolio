            I am a B.Tech Information Technology student with a strong interest in
            web development and software engineering. I enjoy building clean,
            responsive, and user-friendly web applications using modern
            technologies.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            During my diploma studies, I completed an internship at KS Technology,
            where I gained practical exposure to real-world development
            environments and learned how professional projects are planned,
            developed, and maintained.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I am continuously improving my technical skills by building projects,
            learning new technologies, and applying my knowledge through hands-on
            practice.
